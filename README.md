Documentation: The leadership measurement project

Are you leading a team? Are you steering your company into the right direction? How do your employees like working for you? If you want to
know the answer to one of these questions, you should use our website to assess your leadership style. Knowing how you lead and how this is
seen by your employees can impressively improve your team dynamics, personal relationships with employees and ultimately the performance of
your company. Learn how to use your strengths and work on your weaknesses in your leadership position.

Run our web application by typing into the terminal “flask run”.

The first step is to go on our website and register. You can enter any email address or name but be aware that this is the name for which
you will be requesting feedback from your employees.

After registering you should be logged in automatically and see our homepage. This explains to you the concept of the leadership assessment,
so read through it. The first step for you is to then send emails out to feedback givers. Do this by clicking on „request feedback“ on the
navigation bar. You then enter the email of your employee in the field. An email with login credentials and a link to the website will be
sent to them. You can only enter a feedback giver once. A feedback giver is only allowed to give feedback to one manager. Once finished with
entering email addresses (you can always continue this later), click on „self-assessment“ to self-assess your own leadership style.

You will see the same survey that your employees see. The idea is that you answer the questions as honestly as possible, placing yourself
in your employees’ shoes. Think about how you would feel if you were working for yourself and if you would agree with the statements or rather
not. You must answer all questions in order to submit your self-assessment, as only this way can we generate a valuable report.

Once submitted you will be redirected to the homepage. Here you can see the status of your feedback givers and check if they have already
submitted the feedback or not. If they haven’t for a longer time, feel free to follow up on this privately.

Once you have several feedbacks, your report will be more valuable to you. To view your result, click on „view report“ on the navigation bar
(the report will only be shown when a self-assessment as well as at least one employee feedback was submitted).

The report starts with a short explanation on how you should interpret the results of your report. Read this before scrolling down to the
specific results.

Underneath this explanation you see an overall score for your self-assessment as well as for the employee feedback. Each overall score can
be broken down into different categories to which again different questions are used to assess the scores. The categories include the kind
of tasks you give your employees, the relationship they have with you and their team spirit. It also assesses how much the employee identifies
with the mission of the company and how innovative your company is. Lastly, a happiness index indicates how happy your employee is to be working
in your company.
